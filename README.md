JSC-Unit

This is a template for a shellscript to execute Javascript code
using the built-in MacOS JavaScriptCore.framework.

It is useful as a lightweight, absolute bare-bones way to create
a unit-test for some Javascript file that has dependencies on other 
Javascript files in order to run.

This could obviously be done via Node.js, but it's nice to have
the option of avoiding 3PP frameworks.
